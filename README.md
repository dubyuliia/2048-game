2048 Game Project

Description:
2048 is a classic puzzle game where the player slides numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. This project is an implementation of the 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:

Slide Tiles: Use arrow keys to slide tiles left, right, up, or down.
Combine Tiles: Tiles with the same number will combine when slid into each other.
Scoring: Score increases as tiles are combined.
Win Condition: The game ends when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
Lose Condition: The game ends if there are no empty tiles left and no possible moves.

Notes:

This project is created for educational purposes and to demonstrate programming skills in JavaScript.

Technologies Used:

HTML: The game layout and structure are created using HTML. HTML provides the basic framework for displaying content on the web browser.

SCSS are used to style and customize the appearance of the game interface. SCSS is responsible for defining the colors, fonts, layouts, and other visual aspects of the game.

JavaScript: The game logic and functionality are implemented using JavaScript. It enables interactive features, such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and game mechanics implementation.

Event Handling: JavaScript event handling is utilized to detect user input from the arrow keys (←↑→↓) and respond accordingly by sliding the tiles in the respective direction.

DOM Manipulation: Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation is employed to dynamically update the game grid, scores, and messages on the web page based on user interactions and game outcomes.

Random Number Generation: JavaScript's Math.random() function is used to generate random numbers for placing new tiles with values of either 2 or 4 on the game grid.

Conditional Statements and Loops: Conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while) are utilized for implementing game rules, such as combining tiles, checking win or lose conditions, and updating the game state.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is employed for deep copying the game field to track changes between moves and ensure proper functioning of the game logic.

Version Control: Version control systems like Git may be used for managing project versions, tracking changes, and collaborating with other developers.

Web Browser: The game is designed to run in a web browser environment, allowing it to be accessible and playable across various devices and platforms without requiring additional installations.
